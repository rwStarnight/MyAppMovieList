# MyAppMovieList

App MovieList based on React Native

基于React Native的一款关于视频播放列表的App

Updates:

1. first try: display pictures and names of movies.

2. fix errors: the file path was wrong and it took much time to find out the BUG.

3. about UI: add rating stars of movies.

4. douban api: douban changes image from 'jpg' to 'webp', but react-native run-ios can't load 'webp' pics.（I find the bug  that the website path is wrong, so didn't fetch the api.）

5. Navigation: first try and then bug again.(RN always has this issue, npm install)

6. add trailer linking to Detail.
