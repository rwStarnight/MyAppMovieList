# MyAppMovieList

App MovieList based on React Native

基于React Native的一款关于视频播放列表的App

Updates:

1. first try: display pictures and names of movies.

2. fix errors: the file path was wrong and it took much time to find out the problems.

3. about UI: make rating stars of movies 

4. douban api: douban changes image from 'jpg' to 'webp', but react-native run-ios can't load 'webp' pics. I've tried to use react-native-webp adds support for WebP images for react-native components but failed. Now I'll be with imdb-api.
